These transactions, occurring across various locations including El Paso, Washington, San Antonio, Oklahoma City, Nashville, Portland, Phoenix, San Diego, and Louisville, may warrant further review to determine their legitimacy and ensure the security of the accounts involved. The transactions range in amount from $3.65 to $5.55, with the majority being debits.
